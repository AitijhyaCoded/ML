# Machine Learning Practicals
This repository contains a complete **Machine Learning Lab Exam Question Set** designed using **scikit-learn datasets**, covering both **implementation from scratch** and **built-in sklearn models**. The scratch section includes implementations of **Linear Regression** (using Gradient Descent on the Diabetes dataset), **Logistic Regression** (using the sigmoid function for Breast Cancer classification), a **Decision Tree Classifier** (built from entropy-based information gain for the Iris dataset), and **K-Means Clustering** (for Iris data visualization with centroids). It also includes a conceptual explanation of **why feature scaling is important** before algorithms like K-Means or Logistic Regression. The sklearn-based section extends these concepts using ready-made models: **Linear Regression** (Diabetes dataset, full features with coefficients and R²), **Logistic Regression** (Breast Cancer dataset with confusion matrix and report), **SVM** (Iris dataset with linear kernel and decision boundary visualization), **Decision Tree & Random Forest** (Wine dataset comparison with tree visualization and accuracy), **K-Means Clustering** (Iris dataset with cluster comparison), **K-Means on Wine dataset** (with StandardScaler and ARI evaluation), and **Decision Tree vs Random Forest** (Breast Cancer dataset performance comparison using accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importances). This collection provides a well-rounded practice set to master both theory and practical coding aspects of machine learning.
